# Exception Handling Example
In this example, we show how the handling of exceptions. The mechanism is the same that used in freepascal or delphi. You need to just wrap up your statements with the **try..except** keywords. Toro handles exceptions in the same way other kernel does. It invokes the user's code if an exception happens. In Linux, to compile and exceute the application on QEMU, go to the **ExceptionHandling** directory and execute:
```bash
python3 ../CloudIt.py -a ExceptionHandling
```
